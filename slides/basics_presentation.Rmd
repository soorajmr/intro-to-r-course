## Course Outline {.smaller}

The aim is to cover a subset of R features to enable you to do data exploration.  


### 1. Basics, base R

|           Only what is necessary for working with tabular data

### 2. Cleaning and summarising tabular data using **`tidyverse`**
|           This is a particular style, and there are alternatives

### 3. Data visualisation using **`ggplot`**
|           R base plotting is the very popular alternative; we do not focus on that

### 4. Exploratory data analysis practice
|           Examples showing data exploration workflow
|           We will not get into inferential statistics

### 5. Spatial data visualisation
|           Simple maps using vector data

## R Programming Language

- An open source general purpose programming language developed in the 1990's
- A popular platform for statistical computing and graphics 
- More recently, has grown in popularity as a flexible tool to do data preparation and visualisation

## Gazillion Packages {.smaller}

- Packages extend R's functionality
- Huge number of contributed packages for a wide range of things 
- Most packages hosted on the [*The Comprehensive R Archive Network*](https://cran.r-project.org/) (CRAN). 
- A smaller, but increasing number of packages are on Github and [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/).
- Let's take a look at https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/

## RStudio Desktop

- An integrated development environment for R which lets you
    - Write new R code
    - Open existing R code
    - Run (a.k.a. execute) R code to produce some output
    
- Let's take a quick tour of RStudio

## Different Ways of Writing R code on Rstudio

1. As a powerful scientific calculator!
    - Short single line commands that do some calculation or plotting can be typed on RStudio "console" 
    - A good way to start learning R
1. R scripts
    - Code files usually with `.R` extension. Can be created, modified and run on RStudio
    - This course does not focus on this
1. **R Markdown** files to produce html/pdf/Word output of different type
    - In this course, we will focus on html output in these formats:
      - Reports
      - Dashboards
      - Presentations (like the one you are looking at!)

## R Markdown

- A special type of file you create on Rstudio

- lets you combine formatted text and images with the code you write and the output your code generates  
- Simple text formatting options
    - Headings
    - Bold, italics
    - Bullet points, numbered lists

- Great for data analysis - the output can be directly shared with others

- **Practice time**!
    - Open `practice01_rmarkdown.Rmd` in RStudio and read it carefully.

## R as a Calculator {.smaller}

### Arithmetic operations

```{r}
2 * (31 - 10)
355 / 113
10000 * (1 + 0.08)^10
```

### Maths and statistics functions

```{r}
sqrt(2021)
round(sqrt(2021), 2)
```

## Named Objects (Variables)

Using meaningful names to the values we use can make the code more readable. A variable can be thought of a container with a name, which can hold a specific value at a time. The value can be changed if required.

The operator **`<-`** is used to set (assign) a value to a variable.

```{r}
weight_kg <- 80
height_metres <- 1.70
bmi <- weight_kg / height_metres^2
bmi <- round(bmi, 2)
print(bmi)
```

* Certain special symbols, like +, -, /, *, ^, !, $, @, etc. are not allowed in a variable name. 
* The name of an object cannot start with a number.

## Let's Practise

|  Remember: In R code, extra spaces don't change the output of code.  

|  All the three lines below produce identical results. (However, note that `<-` cannot be split as `< -`)

```{r}
bmi<-weight_kg/height_metres^2
bmi <- weight_kg / height_metres ^ 2
bmi            <-     weight_kg       / height_metres  ^            2
```

|  But which is easier to read? <br>
|  Similarly, often, breaking a line of code into multiple lines does not change the result.

```{r}
bmi <-
  weight_kg /
        height_metres^2
```

|  Now open `practice02_calculator.Rmd` in Rstudio and go through the content.
|  Don't forget to "knit" it at the end to produce an html file.

## Conditionals {.smaller}

* Sometimes we have to do one thing if a condition holds true and another thing if it doesn't.
* Comparison operators like ==, >, <, <=, >= give rise to such TRUE or FALSE conditions.
* **`if`** statements help us run different pieces of code for the TRUE and FALSE cases.  
* Often logical AND and OR operations (&, |) are used to combine conditions
* The NOT operator (!) turns a TRUE into FALSE and vice versa.

```{r}
1 == 2
1 < 1.001
```

```{r}
if(bmi < 18.5) {
  print("Underweight")
} else {
  print("Not underweight")
}
```

## Loops {.smaller}

| Loops repeat one operation or a set of operations multiple times.

| Here is an example of a **`for`** loop:

```{r}
sum <- 0
n <- 10
for(i in 1:n) {
  sum <- sum + i
}
sum
```

| `while()` is useful when you don't know how many times to repeat.

```{r}
## See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method
x <- 169
root <- x
tiny <- 1e-10  ## Acceptable error threshold
while(abs(x - root * root) > tiny) {
  root <- (root + x / root) / 2
}
root
```

## Practice Time

Loops and conditionals (control structures)

`practice03_control.Rmd`

## Vectors

* Vectors are objects that contain one or more elements. 
* The elements of a vector should all be of the same type (mode) - numerical, logical, character, etc.

```{r}
ages <- c(22, 13, 38, 5, 26)
birth_years <- 2021 - ages
birth_years
```

```{r}
1:20
```
```{r}
1:10 + 10:1
```

```{r}

```

## Vectors - Indexing  {.smaller}

**`[` index `]`**


```{r}
some_names <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana")
some_names[1]
some_names[c(4, 1, 3)]
some_names[c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]
```
```{r}
dow <- c("Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat")
dow[c(-1, -7)]
```

## Lists

* Lists are the most flexible type of objects in R. 
* Lists can contain just about any type of objects, including lists. 
* They could also be sometimes complex to manipulate. Use lists only when you need them.

```{r}
a <- list(name = "Alice", age = 11, height = 110)
```

## Factors

* Factors are a way of representing categorical data in R.
* They can take only one of the predefined values called levels.
* Factors can be defined as ordered or unordered, depending on whether the data has a natural order relevant to the problem at hand.

```{r}
days <- factor(c("Mon", "Mon", "Thu", "Tue"),
               levels = c("Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"),
               ordered = TRUE)
days[3]

```

```{r}
places <- factor(c("Village", "Town", "Village", "Village"),
                 levels = c("Village", "Hamlet", "Outgrowth", "Town"))
places[1]

```

## Functions

```{r}
compound_interest <- function(initial, rate, n) {
  final <- initial * (1 + rate)^n
  final - initial 
}
```

```{r}
interest <- compound_interest(10000, 0.07, 10)
interest
```

```{r}
compound_interest(rate = 0.07, n = 10, initial = 10000)
```

## Practice

`practice04_vector.Rmd`

## Data Frames {.smaller}

Data frames can be thought of as lists of atomic vectors all having the same length. A data frame represents a table arranged in rows and columns.

```{r}
students <- list(name = c('Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'),
                 age = c(11, 10, 11),
                 status = factor(c("P", "A", "P")))
students_df <- as.data.frame(students)
students_df
str(students_df)
```

## Practice

`practice05_dataframe.Rmd`

## Vectors Again {.smaller}

| An important feature of R is that you can do computation on vectors the same way you do on atomic (single-element) objects. It is possible if the operation we are applying is *vectorised*. All the arithmetic operations, logical and comparison operators and many built-in functions have vectorised implementations in R, meaning the arguments to these operators/functions can be vectors. 

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x > 5
```

| What may be happening below?

```{r}
sum(1 / factorial(0:10))
```

| If you want to calculate the compound interest for several years, instead of writing a loop, you could just pass a vector! When possible, using vectors this way is recommended in R and it is usually more efficient.

```{r}
compound_interest(10000, 10:20, 0.07)
```

## More about vectors: `if ... else` vs `ifelse` {.smaller}

```{r}
numbers <- c(-100, 2, 0.001, 0, -0.00001)
number_to_sign1 <- function(x) {
  if(x < 0){
    "negative"
  } else if(x == 0) {
    "zero"
  } else{
    "positive"
  }
}
number_to_sign1(numbers)
```

```{r}
number_to_sign2 <- function(x) {
  ifelse(x < 0, "negative", 
         ifelse(x == 0, "zero", "positive"))
}
number_to_sign2(numbers)
```

## `NA` or `NaN` values in lists {.smaller}

```{r}
x <- c(-4, 16, 25, -0.1, 36, -0.9, 49.0)
y <- sqrt(x)
y
y > 0
is.na(y)
```

## Handling `NA`

| Remove the NA values

```{r}
y[!is.na(y)]
```

| Sometimes you may want to keep them in the vector, but exclude in the operation

```{r}
mean(y)
mean(y, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Recycling of Vectors {.smaller}

| The second vector is being "recycled":

```{r}
1:20 + c(1, -1)
```

| What does the warning say?

```{r}
1:20 + c(-1, -2, -3)
```
| Index can get recycled, too

```{r}
x <- 1:100
x[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```
