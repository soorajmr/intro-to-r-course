# An Introduction to R for Reproducible Data Analysis

This repository contains the materials used for an intro R workshop focused on exploratory analysis of tabular data. Data preparation/wrangling using `tidyverse` and data visualisation using `ggplot` are covered. The last segment of the course also covers spatial data visualisation using `sf` and `ggplot`. R markdown is used throughout to create reports and dashboards.

The presentations can be seen under the `slides` directory. The order is `basic`, `tidy`, `spatial`. The course heavily relies on the practice Rmd files in the `practice` directory. They are numbered sequentially. The practice examples initially contain simple toy data sets, but the last couple of practice sheets use tables from Census of India 2011.
